Lesson no: 01 (Introduction)
1. Coding interviews are a good tool to check whether the candidate is a good problem solver
2. Coding interview requires 
	A. ability to convey your idea in a computer language
	B. Knowledge of data structure
3. The data structure is a field in ints self however for the coding interview contest you require knowledge of few well-defined data structures

Lesson no: 02 (What are data structures)
1. What is coding -> on the wholistic view Manipulating the data
2. To manipulate the data we need to structure it, Data structure is nothing but a collection of data value, the relationship amongst them, and function or operation applied to them.

Lesson no: 03 (Complexity Analysis)
1. Complexity analysis is required for better understanding of data structures
2. There can be n number of solutions for a problem and complexity analysis helps us ranking the solutions.
3. complexity in terms of computer science mostly comes under time and space complexity.
4. The operation on the data structure comes up with its own time and space complexity.

Lesson no: 04 (Memory)
1. In the computer the memory is limited.
2. memory is made up of bits (0,1), the smallest accessible memory unit is a byte which is 8 bits
3. You can store the address of a variable in the memory slot

Lesson no: 05 (Big O Notation)
1. Big O is a benchmark for the performance of the algorithm.
2. Let's say you want to get some quantitative sense regarding the runtime of your algorithm. you can measure the time it takes to execute however its system dependent and also varies on the same system because of the underlying process carried out by computer.
3. So measuring the time performance in seconds doesn't make any scene and the better way is to measure it concerning data size.
4. Same goes for the space complexity
5. To represent the complexity of the algorithm we use the term with the highest power because as n -> inf smaller terms become less meaningful
6. Most common complexity values are 1.O(1) 2.O(log(n)) 3.O(n) 4.O(n*log(n)) 5.O(n^2) 6.O(2^n) 7.O(n!) and they belongs to worst case.
7. if there are two variables then we will consider both in the time complexity calculation

Lesson no: 06 (Logarithm)
1. In computer science, we always talk of base 2
2. O(log(n)) complexity means you are shrinking the space by half
3. Most of the Tree traversal operations have log(n) complexity

Lesson no: 07 (Array)
1. Array is sequential container with continuous memory allocation
2. Static array -> array, Dynamic array -> vector
3. Basic operation on the array
  A. Read -> space -> O(1), Time -> O(1)
  B. Modify -> space -> O(1), Time -> O(1)
  C. Initialize -> space -> O(n), Time -> O(n)
  D. Traversal -> space -> O(1), Time -> O(n)
  E. Copy -> space -> O(n), Time -> O(n)
  F. Insertion -> space -> O(n), Time -> O(n)
  E. Deletion -> space -> O(n), Time -> O(n)

Lesson no: 08 (LinkedList)
1. Array is sequential container with NON-continuous memory allocation
2. In LinkedList we store the element in Node->[Data | Adr to next Node]
3. The trade of the linkedlist the element is we need extra space to store the adr but it gives the flexibility to store the number where ever we want
4. The linkedList is identified by address of first node(HEAD) and last node in linked list points to NULL(Which is nothing but memory address by Memory management to point to nothing)
5. The linked list can be sibgly connected, doubly connected or circularly connected
6. Basic operation on the array
  A. Read -> space -> O(1), Time -> O(n)
  B. Modify -> space -> O(1), Time -> O(n)
  C. Initialize -> space -> O(n), Time -> O(n)
  D. Traversal -> space -> O(1), Time -> O(n)
  E. Copy -> space -> O(1), Time -> O(n)
  F. Insertion -> space -> O(1), Time -> O(n)
  E. Deletion -> space -> O(1), Time -> O(n)

Lesson no: 09 (Hash Table)
1. In c++ the hash table is implemented as unordered versions of map and sets
2. Under the hood, the hash tables are very complicated to make them more efficient
3. Input -> pass through hash function -> create a value 
4. There is a possibility of a collision which will be caused because of the same output from the hash function
5. Hash table stores the data in key -> value pair and Hash tables are an associative data structure
6. Multiple values for a key(collision) is stored in a linked list or tree or another hash table
7. Basic operation on the array (on average)
  A. Search -> space -> O(1), Time -> O(1)
  B. Insertion -> space -> O(1), Time -> O(1)
  C. Deletion -> space -> O(1), Time -> O(1)

Lesson no: 10 (Stacks and Queues)
1. Stack is LIFO structure and Queue is FIFO
2. Both can be implemented using linked list or array
3. Basic operation on the array 
  A. Search -> space -> O(1), Time -> O(n)
  B. Insertion -> space -> O(1), Time -> O(1)
  C. Deletion -> space -> O(1), Time -> O(1)

Lesson no: 11 (String)
1. String is stored as a array of integer using ASCII coding standard(English char)
2. strings in c++ are mutable that means adding characters in string is constant time
3. Basic operation on the string (
  A. Traversal -> space -> O(1), Time -> O(n)
  B. Copy -> space -> O(n), Time -> O(n)
  C. search -> space -> O(1), Time -> O(1)

Lesson no: 12 (Graphs)
1. Graphs are data structure int which nodes are may or may not be connected
2. The graph is defined by vertices and edges
3. The graph can be defined as a connected or disconnected, directed or undirected, cyclic, or acyclic graph.
4. The graph is stored as an adjacency matrix or adjacency list based on the connectivity
5. The graph is traverse using BFS and DFS ways and space-time complexity is O(V+E)

Lesson no: 12 (Tree)
1. A tree is a hierarchical data structure
2. The tree is a type of graph which is rooted ie. only one parent and only one way to reach the node and tree cant be disconnected
3. A famous type of tree is a binary search tree where every node has at most 2 children and all the nodes on left is smaller than the right one. and min-heap.
4. Most of the operation is O(log(n)) if the tree is balanced
